# Metrofix-OSMS-Web-project
To develop the METROFIX Online Service Management System, we use Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and Google Fonts. The front end uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. PHP is used as the back-end language for handling forms, cookies, and database operations. MySQL is used for the database.
